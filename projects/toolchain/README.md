# Toolchain

The Oblique Toolchain is a collection of Angular schematics and development tools that streamline project setup
and enforce consistent standards. It provides automated configurations for linting, testing, formatting,
and build-time utilities, ensuring that every project follows the same quality and style conventions with
minimal manual effort.

See [README.md](../../README.md) for information about the other packages and projects in the Oblique ecosystem.
