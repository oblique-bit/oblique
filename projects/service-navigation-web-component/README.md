# Service Navigation Web Component

This library simply distributes Oblique's Service Navigation component as a [Web Component](https://angular.dev/guide/elements).
This is useful for non-Angular applications that still use ePortal.

This package is the `@oblique/service-navigation-web-component` library distributed on NPM.

See [README.md](../../README.md) for information about the other packages.
