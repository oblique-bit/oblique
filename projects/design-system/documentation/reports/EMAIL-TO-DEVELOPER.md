Subject: Custom Scripts for Design System - Ready for Use & Enhancement

Hi [Developer Name],

I've set up a comprehensive custom scripts system for our Oblique Design System that should make your development workflow much easier. These scripts handle validation, analysis, and maintenance tasks automatically.

## What's Available

I've created 20+ custom scripts with an AI-powered recommendation system that tells you exactly which scripts to run based on what you're working on. The easiest ways to use it:

```bash
# Just describe what you're doing - AI recommends the right scripts:
npm run recommend:plan "I want to add new button tokens"
npm run recommend:done "I just updated token files"

# Auto-detect changes and get recommendations:
npm run recommend:auto

# Quick validation after any changes:
npm run validate:quick
```

## Key Features

- **Smart recommendations** based on your work (token changes, file renames, documentation updates, etc.)
- **Automated validation** for naming conventions, token syntax, and consumption hierarchy
- **Zero redundancy** - each script serves a specific purpose
- **Copy-paste commands** - no guesswork needed

All documentation is in `scripts-custom/` folder:
- `EASY-RECOMMENDATIONS.md` - Quick start guide
- `README.md` - Full script documentation
- `REDUNDANCY-ANALYSIS-REPORT.md` - System analysis

## Starting Point & Your Freedom

**Important:** These scripts are built with AI assistance as a solid starting point. You have complete freedom to:
- - Use them as-is
- - Modify them to fit your workflow
- - Add new scripts
- - Remove or consolidate scripts
- - Adapt the recommendation system

Think of this as a foundation you can build on rather than a rigid system. The AI recommendations are smart but you know the codebase best.

## ðŸ”§ Quick Test

Try this to see it in action:
```bash
npm run recommend
```

Let me know if you have any questions or want to discuss how to adapt these for your specific needs!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
