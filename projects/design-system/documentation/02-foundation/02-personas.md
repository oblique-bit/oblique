# Design System Personas
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** September 2, 2025  
**Status:** Work in Progress - Not Yet Approved by Product Owner  
**Purpose:** Define stakeholder personas for design system development and decision-making

## **Overview**

This document establishes primary personas for the Oblique Design System, categorized by their relationship to the system: maintainers, consumers, and end users. These personas guide design decisions, feature prioritization, and communication strategies.

**Document Structure:**
- Maintainer personas focus on internal team responsibilities
- Consumer personas represent external teams using the system
- End user personas represent federal application users
- Future expansion planned for accessibility, anti-personas, and user stories
