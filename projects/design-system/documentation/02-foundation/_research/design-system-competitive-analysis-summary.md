# Design System Token Architecture Research - Summary

**Research Date:** September 2025  
**Context:** Size mode implementation strategy validation

## Key Findings

### Industry Patterns

After analyzing token architectures from Carbon, Microsoft Fluent, Adobe Spectrum, and Shopify Polaris:

****Analysis:** No traditional sm/md/lg at token level**
- All major design systems avoid preset size modes in base token architecture
- Size concepts handled through component-specific implementations
- Token layers focus on granular scales for maximum flexibility

****Summary:** Common Approaches:**
- **Numerical Scales**: Spectrum (50,75,100,200), Polaris (025,050,100,150,200)
- **Semantic Names**: Fluent (xxs,xs,s,m,l,xl), Carbon (semantic + numbers)
- **Component-Level Modes**: Size modes implemented in component definitions, not base tokens

### Token Type Strategies

**Separation of Concerns:**
- Component Heights: Often modeable with responsive variants
- Spacing/Padding: Usually fixed values, consistent across contexts
- Clear separation between dimension and spacing token types

**Grid Alignment:**
- Universal 4px or 8px base grid alignment
- Allow micro-adjustments (1px, 2px) for fine-tuning
- Progressive scaling: tighter increments at smaller sizes

## Recommendation

**Hybrid Approach** - Best of both worlds:

```
semantic/
  modes/
    component-size/     # sm/md/lg for component dimensions
      button.json       # height-sm: 32px, height-md: 40px, height-lg: 48px
    density/           # Spacing density modes  
      compact.json     # Tighter spacing multipliers
      comfortable.json # Standard spacing
    viewport/          # Responsive scaling (existing)
      desktop.json     # mult_responsive: 4
      mobile.json      # mult_responsive: 5
```

**Benefits:**
- **Success:** Maintains user-friendly sm/md/lg concepts at component level
- **Success:** Follows industry patterns of granular base scales
- **Success:** Preserves existing responsive multiplier system
- **Success:** Clear separation between component sizing and layout spacing
- **Success:** Maintains 4px grid alignment

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Keep existing base tokens** - semantic/sizing.json with W3C DTCG dimension types
2. **Add component-specific size modes** - semantic/modes/component-size/
3. **Implement density modes** - semantic/modes/density/ 
4. **Migrate gradually** - Start with button component as proof of concept
5. **Validate grid alignment** - Ensure multipliers maintain 4px grid

## Key Takeaway

The industry has evolved toward:
- **Granular base scales** for design flexibility
- **Component-level size modes** for specific use cases
- **Semantic naming** that reflects actual usage
- **Clear separation** between component sizing and layout spacing
- **Responsive handling** at appropriate abstraction levels

Our approach aligns with these patterns while preserving our responsive multiplier system.
