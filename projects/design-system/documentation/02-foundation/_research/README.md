# Foundation Research - Index

This folder contains high-level summaries and key takeaways from design system research. Detailed technical analysis and raw data are maintained in `_private/competitive-analysis/`.

## Research Documents

### [Design System Competitive Analysis Summary](design-system-competitive-analysis-summary.md)
**Key Finding:** No major design system uses traditional sm/md/lg at token level
- Industry analysis of Carbon, Fluent, Spectrum, and Polaris
- Recommendation for hybrid approach with component-level size modes
- Implementation strategy aligning with industry patterns

### [Carbon Design System Sizing Strategy](carbon-sizing-strategy-v11.md) 
**Key Finding:** "Sizing as a mode" validates Oblique's contextual approach
- Carbon v11 migration to contextual inheritance patterns
- Direct validation of Oblique's density + size dual system concept
- Component boundaries and maintainer governance patterns
