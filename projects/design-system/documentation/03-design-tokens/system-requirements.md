# Design Token System Requirements

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Status:** Active Requirements  
**Purpose:** Define high-level requirements and compatibility priorities for the Oblique Design System token architecture

---

## **Tooling Compatibility Priorities**

The design system follows a **pragmatic compatibility hierarchy** where real-world tooling functionality takes precedence over theoretical standards compliance.

### **Priority 1: HIGHEST - Figma Compatibility**
**Status:** Critical - Must Never Break  
**Rationale:** Figma is rigid and provides the design source of truth

#### **Sub-Requirements (Figma):**

**1.1 Token Usability in Figma Variables (HIGH)**
- All tokens must resolve correctly as Figma Variables
- Token structure must be compatible with Figma's variable system
- No token patterns that break Figma's parsing or display
- Variable collections must organize logically in Figma UI
- Mode switching must function correctly within Figma

**1.2 Visual & Functional Consistency for End User UX (HIGH)**  
- Design intent must translate to equivalent end-user experience in code
- Visual hierarchy and relationships maintained between Figma and production
- User interactions must behave consistently with design expectations
- Accessibility features must be represented appropriately (even if simplified)
- Brand consistency preserved across design and implementation

**1.3 Token Value Usage Consistency (LOW)**
- Token values may differ between Figma and code when UX demands it
- Implementation methods can vary (design approximations acceptable)
- Focus on end-user outcome rather than technical implementation matching
- Allow divergent approaches when tooling limitations require it

**Decision Rule:** If a W3C standard conflicts with Figma compatibility → **Choose Figma**

**Exception:** If Figma limitations prevent optimal UX → **Implement design approximations in Figma, prioritize code UX**

---

### **Priority 2: HIGHEST - Code Compatibility** 
**Status:** Critical - Directly Impacts End User UX  
**Rationale:** Code output directly affects end user experience

**Requirements:**
- All tokens must compile to usable CSS/SCSS variables
- Style Dictionary must successfully process all token formats
- Generated code must work across supported browsers
- No compilation errors or broken references
- Maintain performance in generated stylesheets

**Decision Rule:** If W3C standard creates code compilation issues → **Adapt Style Dictionary scripts, not token structure**

---

## **UX Impact Override**

**Meta-Priority:** When optimal user experience cannot be achieved within tooling constraints, **UX impact overrides tooling consistency**.

### **Figma-Code Divergence Strategy**
When Figma's technical limitations prevent optimal UX implementation:

**Approach:** Implement **design approximations** in Figma while delivering optimal UX in code
- **Focus Ring Anatomy**: Simplified visual representation in Figma, full accessibility implementation in code
- **Responsive Density Modes**: Manual mode switching in Figma, automatic responsive behavior in code  
- **Complex Interactions**: Design intent representation in Figma, complete functionality in code

**Guidelines:**
- ✅ **Document divergences** clearly in design specifications
- ✅ **Provide pre-configured templates** to reduce designer workload  
- ✅ **Create clear handoff guidelines** explaining code behavior vs. Figma representation
- ✅ **Prioritize end-user experience** over design tool accuracy

---

### **Priority 3: MEDIUM - Tokens Studio Compatibility**
**Status:** Important - Current Token Management Tool  
**Rationale:** Primary tool for token creation and maintenance

**Requirements:**
- Tokens Studio plugin must read/write token files correctly
- Token organization must work within Tokens Studio UI
- Mode and theme switching must function properly
- Sync between Tokens Studio and Figma Variables must work
- Token validation and error reporting should function

**Decision Rule:** Adapt Tokens Studio workflows if needed, but not at expense of Figma or Code compatibility

---

### **Priority 4: LOWEST - W3C Design Tokens Standard Compliance**
**Status:** Preferred When Possible  
**Rationale:** Future-proofing and industry alignment

**Requirements:**
- Follow W3C DTCG specification where it doesn't conflict with higher priorities
- Use standard token types (`$type`, `$value`, `$description`) when possible
- Maintain standard naming patterns where feasible
- Document deviations from W3C standard with rationale

**Decision Rule:** W3C compliance is **sacrificed** when it conflicts with tooling functionality

---

## **Real-World Decision Examples**

### **UX Impact Override Examples**

#### **Focus Ring Implementation**
```
Figma Limitation: Cannot create true focus ring anatomy
└── Figma Solution: Design approximation for visual design approval
└── Code Solution: Complete CSS outline + box-shadow implementation for accessibility
└── Result: Optimal UX in production, design intent communicated in Figma
```

#### **Responsive Density Modes**  
```
Figma Limitation: Cannot auto-switch density based on viewport
└── Figma Solution: Pre-configured templates + guided mode switching workflow
└── Code Solution: Automatic density="compact" when viewport="mobile"  
└── Result: Optimal responsive behavior in production, structured design workflow in Figma
```

#### **Designer Workflow**
```
Challenge: Complex mode switching increases designer workload
└── Mitigation: Pre-configured Figma templates with correct mode combinations
└── Documentation: Clear guidelines for simulating responsive behavior
└── Handoff: Explicit notes about automatic behavior in code implementation
```

### **Token Type Selection**
```json
// If W3C defines a token type but Tokens Studio → Figma Variables breaks:
// ❌ Don't use W3C type if it breaks Figma
// ✅ Use working alternative, document deviation

// W3C compliant but breaks Figma Variables:
{
  "spacing": {
    "$type": "spacing", 
    "$value": "16px"
  }
}

// Figma-compatible alternative:
{
  "spacing": {
    "$type": "dimension", 
    "$value": "16px"
  }
}
```

### **Style Dictionary Adaptation**
```javascript
// If code generation fails, adapt Style Dictionary:
// ❌ Don't change token structure to fit Style Dictionary
// ✅ Modify transforms/formats to handle token structure

// Custom transform for Figma-optimized tokens:
StyleDictionary.registerTransform({
  name: 'custom/figma-to-css',
  type: 'value',
  matcher: token => token.type === 'figma-optimized',
  transformer: token => adaptForCSS(token.value)
});
```

## **Compatibility Testing Requirements**

### **Mandatory Validation Pipeline**

1. **Figma Variables Validation**
   - All tokens resolve correctly in Figma
   - Variable collections organize properly
   - Mode switching works across themes
   - No parsing errors or missing references

2. **Code Generation Validation** 
   - Style Dictionary compiles without errors
   - Generated CSS/SCSS is syntactically valid
   - All token references resolve correctly
   - Performance acceptable for production use

3. **Tokens Studio Functionality**
   - Plugin reads token files correctly
   - UI displays token organization properly
   - Sync to Figma Variables functions
   - Token editing and validation works

4. **W3C Compliance Check**
   - Document compliance level achieved
   - Note deviations with business rationale
   - Track industry standard evolution
   - Plan future alignment when tooling allows

---

## **Architecture Implications**

### **Token Structure Constraints**

**Driven by Figma Limitations:**
- Variable naming must follow Figma's character restrictions
- Nesting levels limited by Figma's collection structure  
- Token types constrained to Figma-supported types
- Reference chains must work in Figma's resolution system

**Driven by Code Requirements:**
- All calculations resolved in semantic layer (not component layer)
- CSS-valid naming patterns required
- Performance considerations for large token sets
- Browser compatibility for generated values

### **Tooling Integration Strategy**

**Primary Workflow:** `Figma Design ↔ Tokens Studio ↔ Token Files ↔ Style Dictionary ↔ Code`

**Quality Gates:**
1. Design changes validate in Figma Variables
2. Token changes sync through Tokens Studio  
3. Code generation passes all compilation tests
4. W3C compliance documented (when achievable)
