# Design Token System Requirements

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Status:** Active Requirements  
**Purpose:** Define high-level requirements and compatibility priorities for the Oblique Design System token architecture

---

## **Tooling Compatibility Priorities**

The design system follows a **pragmatic compatibility hierarchy** where real-world tooling functionality takes precedence over theoretical standards compliance.

### **Priority 1: HIGHEST - Figma Compatibility**
**Status:** Critical - Must Never Break  
**Rationale:** Figma is rigid and provides the design source of truth

#### **Sub-Requirements (Figma):**

**1.1 Token Usability in Figma Variables (HIGH)**
- All tokens must resolve correctly as Figma Variables
- Token structure must be compatible with Figma's variable system
- No token patterns that break Figma's parsing or display
- Variable collections must organize logically in Figma UI
- Mode switching must function correctly within Figma

**1.2 Visual & Functional Consistency for End User UX (HIGH)**  
- Design intent must translate to equivalent end-user experience in code
- Visual hierarchy and relationships maintained between Figma and production
- User interactions must behave consistently with design expectations
- Accessibility features must be represented appropriately (even if simplified)


**1.3 Token Value Usage Consistency (LOW)**
Implementation methods can vary (design approximations acceptable). Focus on end-user outcome rather than technical implementation matching. Allow divergent approaches when tooling limitations require it.

**Decision Rule:** If a W3C standard conflicts with Figma compatibility → **Choose Figma**

**Exception:** If Figma limitations prevent optimal UX → **Implement design approximations in Figma, prioritize code UX**

### **Priority 2: HIGHEST - Code Compatibility** 
**Status:** Critical - Directly Impacts End User UX  
**Rationale:** Code output directly affects end user experience

**Requirements:**
- All tokens must compile to usable CSS/SCSS variables
- Style Dictionary must successfully process all token formats
- Generated code must work across supported browsers
- No compilation errors or broken references

**Decision Rule:** If W3C standard creates code compilation issues → **Adapt Style Dictionary scripts, not token structure**

---

## **UX Impact Override**

**Meta-Priority:** When optimal user experience cannot be achieved within tooling constraints, **UX impact overrides tooling consistency**.

### **Figma-Code Divergence Strategy**
When Figma's technical limitations prevent optimal UX implementation:

**Approach:** Implement **design approximations** in Figma while delivering optimal UX in code
- **Focus Ring Anatomy**: Simplified visual representation in Figma, full accessibility implementation in code
- **Responsive Density Modes**: Manual mode switching in Figma, automatic responsive behavior in code (media queries)
- **Complex Interactions**: Design intent representation in Figma, complete functionality in code



---

### **Priority 3: MEDIUM - Tokens Studio Compatibility**
**Status:** Important - Current Token Management Tool  
**Rationale:** Primary tool for token creation and maintenance

**Requirements:**
- Tokens Studio plugin must read/write token files correctly
- Token organization must work within Tokens Studio UI
- Mode and theme switching must function properly
- Sync between Tokens Studio and Figma Variables must work
- Token validation and error reporting should function

**Decision Rule:** Adapt Tokens Studio workflows if needed, but not at expense of Figma or Code compatibility

---

### **Priority 4: LOWEST - W3C Design Tokens Standard Compliance**
**Status:** Preferred When Possible  
**Rationale:** Future-proofing and industry alignment

**Requirements:**
- Follow W3C DTCG specification where it doesn't conflict with higher priorities
- Use standard token types (`$type`, `$value`, `$description`) when possible
- Maintain standard naming patterns where feasible
- Document deviations from W3C standard with rationale

**Decision Rule:** W3C compliance is **sacrificed** when it conflicts with tooling functionality
