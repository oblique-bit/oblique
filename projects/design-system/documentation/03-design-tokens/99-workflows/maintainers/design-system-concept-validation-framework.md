# Design System Concept Validation Framework
**Date:** September 7, 2025  
**Purpose:** Universal success metrics for validating design system concepts  
**Context:** Framework for evaluating tokenized, scalable design system solutions

## **Goal:** Framework Overview

### **What is a Design System Concept?**
A **design system concept** is a complete solution addressing a specific design system dimension (sizing, spacing, colors, typography, etc.) that defines:
- **Token architecture** and naming conventions
- **Implementation patterns** across platforms (Figma ↔ Code)
- **Consumer experience** and developer ergonomics
- **Interaction rules** with other concepts

### **Validation Approach**
Each concept must pass through **4 validation phases** using standardized success metrics to ensure consistency, implementability, and scalability across the design system.

## **Goal:** Concept Interaction Framework

### **Inter-Concept Dependencies**
Each concept must define its relationship with other design system concepts:

#### **Primary Dependencies** (Core Integration)
- **Direct Impact**: How this concept affects other concepts
- **Shared Tokens**: Common token dependencies across concepts
- **Conflict Resolution**: Rules for handling concept conflicts

#### **Secondary Dependencies** (Contextual Integration)
- **Performance Impact**: Combined performance implications
- **Complexity Management**: Cumulative cognitive load across concepts
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Shared maintenance responsibilities

### **Concept Maturity Levels**
- **Alpha**: Core architecture defined, basic implementation
- **Beta**: User tested, documented, partial ecosystem integration
- **Stable**: Full implementation, complete documentation, validated
- **Deprecated**: Sunset plan, migration path defined

## **Summary:** Validation Methodology

### **Evaluation Process**
1. **Self-Assessment**: Concept owner evaluates against all criteria
2. **Peer Review**: Design system team validates assessment
3. **User Testing**: Target users validate UX criteria
4. **Technical Review**: Engineering validates implementation criteria
5. **Stakeholder Approval**: Leadership approves concept progression

### **Scoring System**
- **MUST Criteria**: Binary pass/fail (concept blocks on failure)
- **SHOULD Criteria**: Weighted scoring (improvement opportunities)
- **Overall Score**: Weighted average across phases
- **Minimum Viable Score**: 85% overall with all MUST criteria passed
