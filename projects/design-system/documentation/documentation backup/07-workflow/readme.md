# Workflow Documentation
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** September 2, 2025  
**Status:** Work in Progress - Not Yet Approved by Product Owner  
**Purpose:** Organize workflows by audience - maintainers vs consumers

---

## Workflow Organization

The workflow documentation is organized by target audience to provide relevant processes and procedures for different roles in the design system ecosystem.

### **Structure:** Folder Structure

```
07-workflow/
├── maintainers/          # Design system core team workflows
│   ├── README.md         # Maintainer workflow overview
│   ├── 01-bugs.md        # Bug tracking and resolution
│   ├── 02-component-identification.md

└── consumers/            # Design system user workflows
    └── README.md         # Consumer workflow overview (ready for content)
```

### **Note:** Audience Separation

#### Maintainers (`maintainers/`)
**Target:** Design system core team, maintainers, system architects
- System development and maintenance workflows
- Technical debugging and troubleshooting procedures  
- Governance and quality assurance processes
- Tool and infrastructure management

#### Consumers (`consumers/`)  
**Target:** Product teams, developers, designers using the design system
- Implementation and integration guides
- Usage workflows and standard practices
- Adoption checklists and migration guides
- Collaboration and feedback processes

## Benefits of This Organization

### **Success:** Clear Role Separation
- **Maintainers** get system management workflows
- **Consumers** get implementation and usage workflows
- Reduces cognitive load by showing only relevant information

### **Success:** Scalable Structure
- Easy to add new workflows to appropriate audience folders
- Maintains organization as documentation grows
- Supports different governance levels per audience

### **Success:** Better Discoverability
- Users find workflows relevant to their role quickly
- Reduces confusion between system maintenance vs system usage
- Supports different permission levels for different audiences

## Contributing Workflows

When adding new workflow documentation:

1. **Identify the audience** - Who will use this workflow?
2. **Choose the right folder** - Maintainers or consumers?
3. **Follow naming conventions** - Use numbered prefixes for sequential workflows
4. **Include proper headers** - Version, Date, Status, Purpose
5. **Cross-reference related docs** - Link to relevant documentation

### Workflow Types by Audience

#### Maintainer Workflows
- Component development lifecycle
- Token architecture management  
- System debugging and troubleshooting
- Release and version management
- Quality assurance procedures
- Tool and infrastructure setup

#### Consumer Workflows  
- Getting started guides
- Component implementation
- Design handoff processes
- Theme customization
- Testing and validation
- Migration and adoption

## Next Steps

The consumer workflows section is ready for population with:
- Implementation guides for development teams
- Design workflow documentation for designers
- Adoption checklists for product teams
- Integration guides for different frameworks
- Troubleshooting guides for common consumer issues
