## Impact

### Immediate Benefits
- ✅ W3C DTCG compliant token architecture
- ✅ CSS-aligned naming for seamless development
- ✅ Validated HTML/CSS implementation
- ✅ Complete documentation of decisions

### Long-term Value
- 🚀 Future-proofed for evolving design token tools
- 📖 Decision rationale preserved for team knowledge
- 🔄 Scalable pattern for other layout-related tokens
- 🎯 Clear standards for token type classification

## Team Knowledge Transfer

All decisions, reasoning, and implementation details are now permanently documented in git-tracked files within the button component documentation. Future team members can understand:

- Why certain token types were chosen
- How Figma limitations were addressed
- What validation was performed
- How the CSS implementation works
- What standards we're following

This documentation approach ensures institutional knowledge is preserved and accessible for future architectural decisions.
