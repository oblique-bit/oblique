## Internal Research Reports & Decision Documentation

**Component**: Button  
**Last Updated**: September 9, 2025

### Research Overview

This folder contains internal research reports that inform button component architecture and implementation decisions. These reports provide stakeholder transparency into the research and rationale behind design system choices.

### Active Research

#### Competitive Analysis
- [Remove Button Industry Analysis](competitive-analysis/2025-09-09_remove-button-industry-analysis.md) ✅
  - **Status**: Completed
  - **Finding**: Validates `button.remove` subcomponent approach
  - **Impact**: Confirms square constraint and specialized behavior requirements

#### Decision Logs
- [ ] Remove vs Icon-Only Decision (Planned)
- [ ] Size Inheritance Strategy (Planned)
- [ ] Token Architecture Validation (Planned)

#### Technical Research
