### 🎮 Interactive Demo
- **`button-interactive-demo.html`** - Live HTML demo with dropdown controls for testing all button variants and modes

## 🚀 What Was Generated

### Complete Button System (24 Variants)
```
3 Types × 4 States × 2 Inversity Modes = 24 Combinations
├── Primary (regular, hover, pressed, disabled) × (normal, flipped)
├── Secondary (regular, hover, pressed, disabled) × (normal, flipped)  
└── Tertiary (regular, hover, pressed, disabled) × (normal, flipped)
```

### Key Achievements
- ✅ **Timeout Issue Resolution**: Successfully used `forceCode: true` to handle complex component extraction
- ✅ **Complete Type Safety**: Full TypeScript interfaces with proper prop typing
- ✅ **Design Token Integration**: Direct mapping to Oblique design system tokens
- ✅ **Asset Extraction**: 24 SVG icons automatically generated and served
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Clean, maintainable code structure with proper documentation

## 🏗️ Technical Stack

- **Source**: Figma MCP Server (localhost:3845)
- **Generation Method**: `get_code` with `forceCode: true`
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with design token values
- **Assets**: SVG icons via Figma MCP asset server
- **Framework**: React/TypeScript (adaptable to Angular)

## 🔗 Integration Path

To integrate into the design system:

1. **Token Validation**
   ```bash
   npm run trace-token "ob.h.button.color.fg.primary"
   npm run validate:components
   ```

2. **Framework Adaptation**
   - Adapt to Angular following existing patterns
   - Update asset hosting strategy
   - Validate all token references

3. **Testing & Documentation**
   - Add comprehensive unit tests
   - Update component documentation
   - Add to component library
