## Strategic Architecture

The button component is identified as the **highest risk component** for maintenance complexity. This overview focuses on architectural decisions and design principles rather than implementation details.

### Slot-Based Architecture Philosophy

**Separation of Concerns:**
- Badge and tooltip functionality exists as separate slotted containers
- Buttons remain focused solely on interaction behavior
- Auxiliary components can be composed without tight coupling
- Reduces variant explosion from 480+ to under 140 variants

**Maintainability Benefits:**
- Components can evolve independently
- Reusable patterns across the design system
- Simplified testing and debugging
- Clear responsibility boundaries

### Composite Token Strategy

**Design Tool improvement:**
- Composite tokens enable one-click component updates
- Reduces error-prone manual layer editing in Figma
- Specifically designed for Token Studio workflow efficiency
- Scope limited to design tools, not code implementation

## Responsive Design Principles

### Container-Aware Layout Philosophy

**Beyond Viewport-Only Responsive Design:**
Buttons adapt based on **container constraints** and **semantic direction**, solving mobile landscape UX challenges where traditional responsive assumptions fail.

**Key Principle:** Direction ≠ Viewport Size ≠ Container Width
- **Direction**: Semantic intent for content layout
- **Viewport**: Global responsive scaling context
- **Container**: Local space constraints driving layout decisions

### Hybrid Figma Architecture

**Design Tool Simulation Strategy:**
- **Variable Modes**: Simulate CSS media queries (global viewport behavior)  
- **Component Variants**: Simulate CSS container queries (local layout behavior)
- **Designer Control**: Contextual choice independent of viewport assumptions

## Layout Behavior Patterns

### Container-Responsive Strategy

**Adaptive Layout Philosophy:**
- Wide containers enable horizontal button layouts with optimal spacing
- Narrow containers automatically trigger vertical stacking for usability
- Container constraints override viewport assumptions for better UX

**Button Order Logic:**
- **Wide containers**: Primary button positioned last (right-aligned)
- **Narrow containers**: Primary button positioned first (thumb-friendly)

### Direction vs Container Intelligence

**Semantic Direction Control:**
- `data-direction="horizontal"`: Preferred horizontal layout with container-aware fallback
- `data-direction="vertical"`: Intentional vertical stacking regardless of container width

**Container-Aware Behavior:**
- Horizontal direction auto-stacks when container width insufficient (≤480px threshold)
- Vertical direction always stacks regardless of available space
- Maintains touch accessibility across all layout scenarios

## Design Tool Implementation

### Figma Make AI Strategy

For efficient component generation using Figma Make:

**Component Architecture:**
- Slot-based button structure with instance swap properties
- Composite tokens for one-click maintenance updates
- Auto Layout with token-based spacing and sizing
- Separate badge/tooltip containers (not embedded)

**Variant improvement:**
- Target: Under 100 total variants (down from 480+)
- Strategic decomposition: Button_Aug/Text and Button_Aug/Icon-Only
- Container-responsive variants: wide/narrow behavior patterns

## UX Benefits Summary

1. **Container improvement**: Layout adapts to available space, not just viewport size
2. **Touch Accessibility**: Full-width buttons in narrow containers improve interaction
3. **Semantic Clarity**: Direction attributes separate intent from responsive behavior  
4. **Maintenance Efficiency**: Slot architecture reduces variant complexity
5. **Design Tool Efficiency**: Composite tokens enable rapid design updates
