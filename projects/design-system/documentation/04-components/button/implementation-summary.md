2. **button-flex-direction-token-validation.html** (New)
   - Live HTML demonstration of W3C DTCG compliant tokens
   - CSS custom properties + data attributes implementation
   - Interactive toggle between compact/full modes
   - Proof that tokens work perfectly in HTML/CSS despite Figma limitations

3. **width-behavior-token-decision-log.md** (New)
   - Complete decision-making process documentation
   - Problem statement and investigation phases
   - All decisions made with rationale
   - Implementation details and validation results
   - Lessons learned and future considerations

### Token Files (Updated)
**Note:** **Location**: `src/lib/themes/05_html/button_aug/06 width/`

1. **compact.json** (Updated)
   - Fixed `"$type": "other"` → `"$type": "string"` (W3C DTCG compliant)
   - CSS-aligned property names (flex_direction, align_items, etc.)
   - Added Figma limitation notes to descriptions

2. **full.json** (Updated)  
   - Fixed `"$type": "other"` and `"$type": "text"` → `"$type": "string"`
   - Updated structure to match CSS-aligned naming convention
   - Unified structure with compact.json
   - Added Figma limitation notes to descriptions

## Key Achievements

### **Goal:** Standards Compliance
- All tokens now follow W3C Design Tokens Community Group specification
- Future-proofed for design token tool compatibility
- Professional compliance with industry standards

### **Setup:** Developer Experience
- Token names directly match CSS properties (no mental mapping required)
- Modern CSS custom properties + data attributes pattern
- Live validation demo proves implementation works

### **Note:** Documentation Excellence
- Complete decision rationale tracking
- Professional explanation of Figma limitations
- Clear alternative approaches for different tools
- Live demonstration of token utility

### **Design:** Design Tool Strategy
- Honest acknowledgment of tool limitations
- Clear guidance: use component variants in Figma, tokens in HTML/CSS
- Professional tone in limitation descriptions

## Impact

### Immediate Benefits
- **Success:** W3C DTCG compliant token architecture
- **Success:** CSS-aligned naming for seamless development
- **Success:** Validated HTML/CSS implementation
- **Success:** Complete documentation of decisions

### Long-term Value
- **Quick Start:** Future-proofed for evolving design token tools
- **Note:** Decision rationale preserved for team knowledge
- **Process:** Scalable pattern for other layout-related tokens
- **Goal:** Clear standards for token type classification

## Team Knowledge Transfer

All decisions, reasoning, and implementation details are now permanently documented in git-tracked files within the button component documentation. Future team members can understand:

- Why certain token types were chosen
- How Figma limitations were addressed
- What validation was performed
- How the CSS implementation works
- What standards we're following

This documentation approach ensures institutional knowledge is preserved and accessible for future architectural decisions.
