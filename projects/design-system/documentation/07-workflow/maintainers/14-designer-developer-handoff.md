# Designer-Developer Handoff Protocol

**Purpose:** Clear handoff requirements and push-back procedures for tokenization workflow  
**Audience:** Designers, Developers, Design System Maintainers  
**Scope:** Component validation, handoff criteria, quality gates  

---

## **Goal:** Handoff Overview

The designer-developer handoff is a **quality gate** ensuring 04_components meet tokenization standards before implementation. This protocol establishes clear criteria for approval and push-back procedures to maintain design system integrity.

### Core Principle
**"No 04_component implementation without complete tokenization validation"**

---

## **Requirements:** Designer Handoff Requirements

### **Setup:** Pre-Handoff Deliverables

**1. Complete Tokenization Coverage**
- [ ] All design properties tokenized via Token Studio
- [ ] Token Studio connections verified and active
- [ ] Figma Variables exported and assigned
- [ ] Future-proof tokens created for unsupported properties

**2. Validation Documentation**
- [ ] MCP Figma validation report generated
- [ ] complete tokenization assessment complete
- [ ] Layer naming compliance verified
- [ ] Composite token evaluation documented

**3. Component Documentation**
- [ ] Token mapping documentation provided
- [ ] Component behavior specifications written
- [ ] Implementation notes and special requirements documented
- [ ] Related 04_component dependencies identified

**4. Quality Assurance**
- [ ] Zero hardcoded values in validation report
- [ ] All layer names follow compound unit format (underscore_format)
- [ ] Token Studio integration health verified
- [ ] Component variants maintain token consistency

### **Document:** Required Documentation Checklist

**Validation Report Package:**
- complete MCP validation report (zero violations)
- Token inventory and usage instructions
- Layer naming compliance verification
- Composite token assessment and recommendations

**Component Specification:**
- Behavioral requirements and interaction patterns
- Responsive design specifications
- Accessibility requirements and considerations
- Integration requirements with other 04_components

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- Token mapping and usage instructions
- Special implementation considerations
- Known limitations or workarounds
- Testing and validation requirements

## **Success:** Developer Acceptance Criteria

### **Goal:** Automatic Approval Conditions

Components receive **automatic approval** when:
- [ ] Validation report shows **zero violations**
- [ ] **Complete tokenization coverage** verified
- [ ] **All layer names compliant** with compound unit standards
- [ ] **Token Studio connections active** and verified
- [ ] **Composite token evaluation complete** with clear recommendations
- [ ] **Documentation package complete** and complete

### **Warning:** Conditional Approval

Components may receive **conditional approval** with documented remediation plan when:
- Minor violations with clear resolution timeline
- Missing documentation with commitment to provide within 48 hours
- Token Studio connection issues with technical workaround available
- Future-proofing tokens pending Figma tool updates

### **Error:** Automatic Rejection

Components receive **automatic rejection** when:
- Validation report shows tokenization violations
- Hardcoded values detected in 04_component
- Layer names violate compound unit standards
- Missing Token Studio connections
- Incomplete or missing validation documentation
- Component behavior specifications unclear or missing

---

## **Note:** Developer Push-Back Authority

### **Goal:** Push-Back Criteria

Developers **MUST push back** 04_components that exhibit:

**Critical Violations:**
- **Tokenization gaps**: Any hardcoded values present
- **Layer naming violations**: Non-compliant naming patterns
- **Connection failures**: Missing Token Studio integration
- **Documentation gaps**: Incomplete validation or specification

**Quality Issues:**
- **Inconsistent tokenization**: Mixed token application patterns
- **Missing composite opportunities**: Complex 04_components without composite token evaluation
- **Validation shortcuts**: Incomplete MCP validation process
- **Specification ambiguity**: Unclear implementation requirements

### **Note:** Push-Back Process

**Step 1: Issue Documentation**
1. Reference specific validation report violations
2. Document all non-compliance issues found
3. Provide clear remediation requirements
4. Set timeline expectations for resolution

**Step 2: Communication Protocol**
1. **Formal notification** to designer with violation details
2. **Copy design system maintainers** on push-back communication
3. **Document push-back** in 04_component tracking system
4. **Schedule review** for remediation verification

**Step 3: Resolution Tracking**
1. **Monitor remediation progress** against timeline
2. **Re-validate** 04_component after designer updates
3. **Approve or escalate** based on resolution completeness
4. **Document lessons learned** for process improvement

### **Process:** Escalation Procedures

**When to Escalate:**
- Repeated push-backs for same 04_component
- Designer disputes push-back criteria
- Timeline conflicts affecting project delivery
- Technical limitations preventing compliance

**Escalation Path:**
1. **Design System Lead** - Process interpretation and guidance
2. **Design Operations** - Resource allocation and priority management
3. **Product Leadership** - Strategic decisions and trade-off evaluation

## **Summary:** Quality Metrics & Success Criteria

### **Goal:** Handoff Success Metrics

**Quality Indicators:**
- **First-pass approval rate**: Target >85% of 04_components approved without push-back
- **Violation resolution time**: Average <48 hours from push-back to resubmission
- **Token coverage completeness**: >95% of properties tokenized
- **Documentation completeness**: 100% of required deliverables provided

**Process Efficiency:**
- **Handoff cycle time**: Designer submission to developer approval
- **Push-back frequency**: Percentage of 04_components requiring remediation
- **Validation report quality**: Completeness and actionability of MCP reports
- **Composite token adoption**: Usage rate for complex 04_components

### **Progress:** Continuous Improvement

**Regular Review Process:**
- **Weekly metrics review** - Track handoff success rates
- **Monthly process evaluation** - Identify improvement opportunities
- **Quarterly standards update** - Evolve criteria based on learnings
- **Annual workflow improvement** - Major process refinements

**Feedback Integration:**
- **Designer feedback** on push-back clarity and actionability
- **Developer feedback** on documentation quality and completeness
- **Stakeholder feedback** on process efficiency and timeline impact
- **Tool feedback** on MCP validation accuracy and coverage
