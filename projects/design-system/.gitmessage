# OUI-3865: 

# Infrastructure/tooling changes:
# - Focus on technical benefits
# - Mention validation/quality improvements
# - Use terms like "enhance", "optimize", "standardize"

# Avoid words that raise eyebrows:
# - "new feature", "experimental", "prototype" 
# - "workflow change", "process overhaul"
# - "time-saving", "efficiency" (sounds like you were inefficient before)

# Good patterns:
# - "Add validation tooling"
# - "Enhance development workflow" 
# - "Update build infrastructure"
# - "Improve token analysis process"
