<p>
	This feature offers a nice way to display error messages related to a form element. The <strong>directive</strong> is meant for Material Design while the
	<strong>component</strong> is meant for Bootstrap.
</p>

<div class="material-only">
	<p>
		The <code>ErrorMessages</code> directive should be put on a <code>mat-form-field</code> component and works in conjunction with a
		<code>mat-error</code> component, both from Angular. The <code>mat-error</code> component have to be present through empty and will be automatically
		populated with translations of thrown validation errors.
	</p>

	<div class="alert alert-info">
		<h2>Directive is irrelevant with Bootstrap</h2>
		<p>The directive only populates the <code>mat-error</code> component, which means it must not be used with <strong>Bootstrap</strong>.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="alert alert-warning">
		<h2>Component is deprecated with Material Design</h2>
		<p>
			The component is meant to be used with Bootstrap. Material theme should use either the directive or the
			<a href="https://material.angular.io/components/form-field/overview#error-messages">Angular implementation</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a partially deprecated component, it won't be prioritized for new features or improvements but won't be removed as long as Bootstrap is
			supported.
		</p>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="bootstrap-only">
	<p>
		If used within the <code>orFormControlState</code> directive, the component will automatically display the errors of the related control. In that case,
		the errors will be displayed in red, thanks to the <code>has-error</code> class set by the directive.
	</p>
	<p>
		When used outside of the <code>orFormControlState</code> directive, the component can be placed anywhere on the page but then the source control has to
		be specified through the <code>control</code> input. In that case, no styling will be applied to the content.
	</p>
	<div class="alert alert-warning">
		<h2>Directive is irrelevant with Bootstrap</h2>
		<p>The directive is meant to be used with material Design. Bootstrap theme should use the component.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="alert alert-info">
		<h2>Component is deprecated with Material Design</h2>
		<p>This component is only deprecated with Material Design. With Bootstrap theme, it can and should be used.</p>
		<p>
			As a partially deprecated component, it won't be prioritized for new features or improvements but won't be removed as long as Bootstrap is
			supported.
