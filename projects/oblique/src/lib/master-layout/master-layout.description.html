	This component takes care of the page's structure. It contains the header and footer, manages off-canvas and spinner, and displays
	notifications. It is fully live configurable and its default values can be tweaked through the <code>MasterLayoutConfig</code>
	injectable. Padding is added per default to the
	<code>main-layout</code> and can be removed with the <code>layout.hasLayout</code> variable.
</p>
<p>
	The main navigation is generated from the <code>ObINavigationLink</code> input. It supports url fragments and query parameters as well as
	external links. External links will be automatically opened in a new tab, but they can be forced in the current one with the
	<code>sameTarget</code> property.
</p>
<p>
	Main navigation entries can also be enhanced with an icon that will be displayed on the left hand side of the link (the other side being
	reserved for the dropdown toggle). The label, while mandatory for accessibility reasons, can be hidden through the
	<code>iconOnly</code> property. For consistency reasons, it is advised to either use icons for all entries or none of them.

	Oblique 10.1.0 introduces the <code>ob-service-navigation</code> component that replaces the whole right hand area of the header (the part
	where the language selection and the projected <code>obHeaderControl</code> elements are located). This component intends to replace the
	Header Widget without the need of a Web Component. With Oblique 11, the change has be mandatory, this means that
	<code>obLocales</code> and <code>obHeaderCustomControl</code> content projection options have been removed. It is still be possible to
	pass custom controls or an alternate language selection through the <code>obHeaderControl</code> content projection option.
